# SQL

Welcome to my personal SQL portfolio repository! In this space, you'll discover SQL projects and queries I've developed, highlighting my skills and expertise in database management, data analysis and data manipulation with SQL.

**[Employee Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/michalskakatarzyna/Employee-Attrition/)** This repository contains SQL code for examining employee attrition within an organization. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors influencing attrition rates, including salary, job level, performance and demographic information. The insights gained aim to identify the most problematic groups at risk of higher turnover and provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention strategies. This analysis utilizes a fictional dataset developed by IBM data scientists, available on Kaggle.
